2. What problems / warnings are there with code?

Ans. 
error 1: 
In WrappedSingleListItem, the onClickHandler function is being called immediately instead of being passed as a callback function. 
This will cause onClickHandler to be called as soon as the component is rendered, rather than when the list item is clicked.

error 2: 
In WrappedListComponent, the useState hook is not being used correctly. 
The first argument to useState should be the initial state value, but it is missing in this case.
Also, setSelectedIndex is assigned the value of null, which is not a valid state value.
Instead, the initial state value for selectedIndex should be set to 0, since that is the index of the first item in the list.

error 3: 
In WrappedListComponent propTypes, there is a syntax error.

error 4: 
In the same propTypes definition for WrappedListComponent, the PropTypes.string.isRequired validation is not set correctly for the items prop.
